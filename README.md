# Multiple-Round-Q-A-bot
I just built a Multiple-Round Question Answering Bot using Python 🐍, Pandas 📊, and Hugging Face (pipeline) 🤖. This all powered locally with a real world dataset on Dengue cases on Sri Lanka during 2010 - 2020 📈.

🔍 This project helped me deepen my understanding of NLP, data handling, and building interactive AI applications locally.
